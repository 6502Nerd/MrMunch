25 year evolution, started as a C++ game under DirectX for Win95, now C sharp under Win10

I started this game to learn Win95 programming under the new DirectX libraries - around 1996.
Those days I was working in the fruit machine industry, hence the idea to collect three fruits to get a bonus!

This game was the basis of even a Java ME version for small-screen mobile phones!

Provided here for those interested in how to get writing simple games - hope it helps!

25 year evolution, started as a C++ game under DirectX for Win95, now C sharp under Win10

This simple game was originally written back in 1996-ish, in C++ using the then quite new DirectX libraries,
as an experiment in using this faster than GDI library.  A good few years ago I converted from C++ to C# and
managed DirectX.

Now in 2021, I have upgraded it to Windows 10, using SharpDX library to help with the conversion as DirectX
is no more (in fact SharpDX is now no more too, from around 2019).

Those days I was working in the fruit machine industry, hence the idea to collect three fruits to get a bonus!

This game was the basis of even a Java ME version for small-screen mobile phones!

Provided here for those interested in how to get writing simple games - hope it helps!
